A clone of a word game in which the user must correctly guess a five-letter word in six tries.

## Getting Started

First you need an API key from [RapidAPI] (https://rapidapi.com/hub) for both:

- [Random Word API] (https://bit.ly/random-word-api 'Random Word API')

You can get one by creating an account on their website. After you got your API key, create a `.env` file at root of the project and fill with the following:

```
RAPID_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
